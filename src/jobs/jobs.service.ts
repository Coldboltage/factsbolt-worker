      Nuance and Complexity: Ensure that the analysis reflects the depth and diversity of views on the subject. Strive to uncover and explore the foundational beliefs and assumptions underpinning the speaker's statements, going beyond surface-level interpretations. Recognize areas where evidence is strong, where it's emerging, and where there's legitimate debate. Avoid over-simplifications.

Is the speaker criticizing or commenting on a specific individual, a group of people, a system or institution, or a general concept or idea? Try to determine the primary source of the speaker's sentiment and the main issue at stake, based on their statements.

      Verifiable facts: Identify any statement that presents a clear fact or claim about reality that can be confirmed using publicly accessible data, well-established knowledge in the field, or widely recognized information. Elaborate on why you believe it to be a verifiable fact and provide detailed information and references that support it. Discuss the potential utility of this fact, including how it could be used or applied in different scenarios.

      Personal facts: Note any statements that are based on personal experience or knowledge and are true for the individual, but can't be independently verified by others. Discuss the potential utility of this personal fact, including how it may influence understanding or perspective.

      Grounded Speculations: Label a statement as grounded speculation if it makes a prediction or guess about the future based on current trends or data. Discuss the current trends, data, or historical events that support this speculation. Evaluate the potential utility or impact if this speculation was acted upon.

      Grounded Opinions: Recognize statements of personal preference or judgement as grounded opinions if they are based in well-reasoned thinking or empirical evidence. Aim to uncover deeper motivations or beliefs driving these opinions. Discuss the empirical evidence or logical reasoning that supports these grounded opinions, and discuss the potential utility or impact of these grounded opinions if adopted.

      Baseless Speculation: Identify statements that speculate or predict without a clear or logical basis in data or facts. As this could potentially be misleading or damaging, no utility analysis will be provided for these points.

      Baseless Opinions: Recognize statements of personal judgement or bias that are not backed by evidence or sound reasoning. Like with baseless speculation, no utility analysis will be provided due to the potential for misinformation or harm.

This should not be used to lend legitimacy to baseless theories or misinformation, but to acknowledge when there are different viewpoints within the realm of reasonable interpretation.

      Consideration of Multiple Perspectives: When there is legitimate debate around the facts, showcase different viewpoints within the scope of reasonable interpretation. Be cautious not to legitimize misinformation.

      Each major statement should be analyzed separately, maintaining a structured and thorough approach throughout the analysis.

      Please note that the transcript is an array of speeches from speakers using this format:

      export interface AmendedSpeech {
        speaker: string;
        text: string;
      }

      You will be given an array after the transcription which will have the type of AmendedSpeech or more.

      I've made these interfaces to help assist in the Output structure.

        speaker: string;
