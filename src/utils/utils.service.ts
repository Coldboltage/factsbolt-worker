    const baseTemplateQuestion = (title: string, transcript: string) => {
      return `Please evaluate the following transcript with the help of the documents/context provided, as context that might have come out after the 2023 training data. Begin by providing a brief context or summary of the overall conversation to help set the stage for the detailed analysis. Proceed with a methodical analysis of each major statement, while simultaneously maintaining an awareness of the overall context of the conversation.
      
    Carefully dissect the transcript into distinct contextual sections, each focusing on a separate point or topic, while ensuring that each section is aware of and relates coherently to every other section, to allow for precise and targeted fact-checking of each segment independently as well as in the context of the entire transcript.
    
    Break down these statements into individual points or closely related sentences to understand the nuances, but regularly refer back to the broader conversation to ensure that each point is evaluated within its proper context. This approach aims to provide a thorough dissection of each statement while preserving the interconnectedness and flow of the conversation. By doing this, the evaluation will be more balanced, acknowledging both the specific details of individual statements and their meaning within the larger dialogue. For each point, identify it as either a Verified Fact, Provisionally Unverified, Personal Fact, Grounded Speculation, Grounded Opinion, Baseless Speculation, Baseless Opinion, Manipulative Opinion, Manipulative Speculation, Contextually Manipulated Fact, Question, or Incomplete Statement. Consider the context in which the statement is made to ensure accurate categorization.

    When evaluating each statement within the provided documents/context, conduct a meticulous assessment of each source's credibility. This evaluation should include an in-depth examination of the author's expertise and qualifications, the source's history of accuracy and reliability, any potential biases or agendas, and the timeliness and relevance of the information presented. Cross-reference facts with multiple reputable sources, prioritizing primary sources and recognized authorities in the field. In cases of conflicting information, seek additional corroborative sources to discern the most robustly supported viewpoint. Document each step of this evaluation process, providing explicit justifications for the credibility assigned to each source. Regularly update and review source credibility, especially for ongoing analyses, to ensure the most current and accurate information is being utilized. This rigorous approach to source evaluation is crucial to ensure that the analysis is grounded not only in factual accuracy but also in the reliability and integrity of the information's origin.

    Including such a guideline will help in categorizing information more accurately, especially in distinguishing between verified facts, unverified claims, and speculations, thereby enhancing the overall quality and reliability of the analysis.

    Emphatic Expressions: Recognize when speakers use emphatic or strong language to underscore a sentiment. Distinguish between literal claims and expressions meant to emphasize the severity or importance of a point. Describe such expressions in a neutral tone, avoiding terms that might introduce undue doubt.

    Nuance and Complexity: Ensure that the analysis reflects the depth and diversity of views on the subject. Strive to uncover and explore the foundational beliefs and assumptions underpinning the speaker's statements, going beyond surface-level interpretations. Recognize areas where evidence is strong, where it's emerging, and where there's legitimate debate. Avoid over-simplifications.

    Identify the main target or subject of the speaker's comments. Is the speaker criticizing or commenting on a specific individual, a group of people, a system or institution, or a general concept or idea? Try to determine the primary source of the speaker's sentiment and the main issue at stake, based on their statements.

    Ensure a thorough exploration of the broader historical, economic, political, social, and cultural context surrounding the transcript's content. This includes identifying and analyzing relevant factors such as the historical background, economic conditions, political landscape, societal norms, and cultural influences that may impact the interpretation and understanding of the statements. Be adaptable in your approach to contextual analysis, recognizing that each transcript presents unique challenges and requires a nuanced understanding of the diverse and dynamic factors that shape the conversation.

    "Verified facts are statements that present clear facts or claims about reality. For every verified fact, evaluation involves referencing training data up to April 2023 and considering any documented context supplied. Verification must include corroboration from at least one neutral, independent source, in addition to any other source. This can be done by:

    a) Quoting directly from context documents/context, including at least one neutral source, to serve as a citation.
    b) Referencing training data or external information, providing a specific reference akin to: 'As found in a study from [Specific Year] in [Specific Source Name],' or 'According to [Authoritative Source],' ensuring at least one of these is a neutral source.

    Facts or claims must align with well-established knowledge and be corroborated by credible sources, including at least one independent and neutral source. When a statement aligns with training data and documented context, elaborate on why it is considered a verified fact, discussing its factual accuracy, source credibility, and potential implications or applications. If the fact is part of a larger narrative with a specific intent (e.g., manipulative, speculative), this context should be noted, with emphasis on neutral source corroboration to ensure unbiased verification."

    Within the source verification, specifically reference the actual source used for verification, providing clarity on how it supports the fact.

    Partially Verified: Statements or claims categorized as "Partially  Verified" are those where the available evidence or sources are insufficient for full verification but also do not warrant outright dismissal. This category recognizes the potential validity of the information while acknowledging that it requires further evidence or corroboration.

    Contextually Manipulated Facts: Identify statements that present facts or claims verified through your training data up to April 2023, documented context, or credible public sources, but are potentially misleading or taken out of context. Label these as 'Contextually Manipulated Fact.' Confirm the factual accuracy of the statement and provide a detailed analysis of the context in which it is presented. Discuss what additional information is necessary for a full understanding and if the source or presentation contributes to a misleading or manipulative narrative. Evaluate the potential utility and harm of these manipulated facts, discussing how they could be used or misused in different scenarios. Include any counterpoints or alternative perspectives that could add valuable context to the fact in question, noting if these counterpoints are supported by your training data or other credible sources.

    Unverified Claims: Label statements presented as facts or claims about reality that currently lack verifiable evidence or reliable sources as 'Unverified Claims.' In your analysis, clearly explain why the statement is categorized as unverified, detailing both the specific nature of the claim and what evidence or sources are missing that prevent full verification. This should include a description of the types of evidence that would be necessary to substantiate the claim, such as credible reports from established authorities or direct evidence from multiple independent and reliable sources. While the claim remains unverified, it does not necessarily mean it is false; further research or future information could potentially confirm its accuracy. Discuss the potential implications of accepting the claim without sufficient verification and encourage the audience to maintain a critical perspective, acknowledging the limitations in the current evidence. Highlight that the unverified status is based on the available information at the time of analysis and could change with new developments. Emphasize the importance of continual engagement with emerging evidence and a cautious approach to claims that could significantly impact public perception or policy.

    Personal facts: Note any statements that are based on personal experience or knowledge and are true for the individual, but can't be independently verified by others. Discuss the potential utility of this personal fact, including how it may influence understanding or perspective.

    Grounded Speculations: Label a statement as grounded speculation if it makes a prediction or guess about the future based on current trends or data. Discuss the current trends, data, or historical events that support this speculation. Evaluate the potential utility or impact if this speculation was acted upon.

    Grounded Opinions: Recognize statements of personal preference or judgment as grounded opinions if they are based on well-reasoned thinking or empirical evidence. These statements should be supported by logical reasoning or data that can be independently verified. Discuss the empirical evidence or logical reasoning that supports these grounded opinions, and discuss the potential utility or impact of these grounded opinions if adopted.
    
    Baseless Speculation: Identify statements that speculate or predict without a clear or logical basis in data or facts. As this could potentially be misleading or damaging, no utility analysis will be provided for these points.

    Baseless Opinions: Recognize statements of personal judgement or bias that are not backed by evidence or sound reasoning. Like with baseless speculation, no utility analysis will be provided due to the potential for misinformation or harm.

    Manipulative Opinion: Identify statements that express a viewpoint or judgment and are presented in a way that aims to deceive, mislead, or provoke strong emotional responses. This could include the use of emotionally charged language, exaggerations, or rhetorical devices designed to manipulate the audience's perception. Whether the opinion is grounded in empirical evidence or not, provide an analysis that discusses the underlying evidence or reasoning, if any, and how it is being used manipulatively.

    Manipulative Speculation: Identify statements that make predictions or guesses, whether based on current trends, data, or without any clear basis, but are presented in a misleading or deceptive manner. Label these as 'Manipulative Speculation'. Discuss any trends, data, or historical events that may or may not support this speculation, and elaborate on how the statement is being used to deceive or mislead.

    Questions: These are inquiries or requests for information, often seeking clarification or further details on a particular topic. Discuss the utility of these questions in providing greater clarity or understanding.

    In cases where there is legitimate debate or different interpretations regarding the facts, please highlight and discuss these perspectives. This should not be used to lend legitimacy to baseless theories or misinformation, but to acknowledge when there are different viewpoints within the realm of reasonable interpretation.

    Provide a thorough and detailed explanation for each point, discussing the nuances, implications, and potential effects or consequences of each statement.

    After categorizing and explaining each point, provide an in-depth overall assessment of the content, labelled as overall assessment. This should include a discussion of any major inaccuracies, unsupported claims, or misleading information, an evaluation of the overall validity of the points presented, an exploration of the implications or potential effects of these points, and a review of any notable strengths or weaknesses in the arguments made. State the categories that appeared with regularity

    Afterwards, we'll do a Consensus Check, labelled as Consensus Check. Start by immediately stating if the views or information presented align or do not align with recognized best practices, consensus, or research in the field. After this initial alignment statement, delve into the specifics. Evaluate the content to determine how closely it matches the prevailing consensus, recognized best practices, the most robust evidence available, and the latest, most accepted research. Summarize the primary sentiments or messages of the content. If these views are in accordance with well-established norms or knowledge, detail the reasons for this alignment. Conversely, if there are discrepancies, specify the reasons for non-alignment. Additionally, critically examine any strategies, advice, or opinions shared and assess how they compare with the consensus of leading experts, authoritative bodies, or reputable scientific research.

    Assess not just whether these strategies, advice, or opinions are widely accepted or popular, but also whether they align with the prevailing consensus among experts in the field.

    Additionally, ensure to differentiate between views held by the majority and those held by a minority that may seem to be growing in influence. It's important not to incorrectly attribute a minority viewpoint as a majority consensus if a significantly larger consensus exists on a particular topic.

    Comment on how the speakers' views align or contrast with these recognized best practices and consensus. Especially note any instances of both grounded and baseless speculation and discuss how they may influence perceptions and understandings of the topic.

    In particular, assess the extent to which the speaker's sentiment is shared among the majority, and whether this majority consensus itself aligns with best practices or expert opinion. Be critical in distinguishing between common critiques or views and those which are supported by empirical evidence and expert consensus. Avoid drawing conclusions solely based on the prevalence of a particular view without examining its grounding in established and credible sources of knowledge in the field.

    Labelled, Consideration of Multiple Perspectives: Evaluate the primary perspective of the speaker. If they focus on a specific viewpoint or aspect, recognize that without introducing undue doubt. However, note if there are widely recognized alternative perspectives or nuances that the speaker might not have covered.

    Labelled, Fact Check Conclusion: Assess the general conclusion and overall reliability of a speaker's statements, then distill this information into a succinct "Fact Check Conclusion." Consider both the evidence presented and any logical or common-sense assumptions that may support the advice or information. The conclusion should guide the reader in layman terms on the practicality, potential reliability, and applicability of the content, even when full evidence isn't available.

    Labelled, Democratic Values and Consensus: Assess the extent to which the speaker's views and arguments align with democratic values, principles, and the current democratic consensus on the topic. Note any instances where the speaker's views diverge from these democratic standards and discuss how this might influence the conversation and the audience's understanding of the topic. Compare the speaker's views with the prevailing democratic consensus, noting any areas of agreement or disagreement.

    Labelled, Contextual Conclusion: Summarize the overall context in which facts, opinions, and speculations are presented in the transcript. Explicitly flag and highlight any recurring themes of contextual manipulation, misleading presentation, or instances where grounded opinions and speculations are used manipulatively. Assess the broader implications of these contextual issues on the validity of the speaker's arguments, the potential impact on public perception, and any attempts to steer the narrative away from the truth. This conclusion should guide the reader in understanding the practicality, reliability, and applicability of the content, especially in the context of any manipulative tactics identified.

    Labelled, Middle Ground Conclusion: In crafting a middle-ground conclusion, it is crucial to adopt a balanced and nuanced perspective when analyzing complex topics, especially those involving social, political, or multifaceted issues. The middle ground represents a viewpoint that strives to find common ground among differing opinions and takes into account the following key principles:

    Balanced Understanding of Complexities:
    Begin by thoroughly unpacking the complexities of the issue at hand. This involves providing a comprehensive explanation of the various factors, circumstances, and nuances contributing to the problem. Consider economic, social, political, and environmental elements as well as historical and systemic factors. Your analysis should address questions like: "Why is this issue so complex? What are the multiple factors influencing it?"
    
    Recognition of Specific Efforts and Progress:
    Identify and describe the specific efforts, policies, initiatives, or actions that have been undertaken to address the issue. Evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts by detailing the progress achieved in specific areas. Explore the question: "What specific actions have been taken to tackle the problem, and where has progress been made?"
    
    Acknowledgment of Ongoing Challenges and Unmet Needs:
    Highlight the persistent challenges and limitations of current approaches. Examine why these challenges continue to exist and what critical needs remain unmet. Delve into questions like: "What are the ongoing challenges, and why do they persist? What needs are yet to be fully addressed?"
    
    Synthesize into a Coherent Middle-Ground View:
    Based on your detailed exploration of complexities, efforts, and challenges, craft a middle-ground conclusion. This conclusion should synthesize the gathered information into a coherent viewpoint that acknowledges the multifaceted nature of the issue. Explain why this balanced view is considered the middle ground, considering the various perspectives and data presented.
    
    Emphasize the Rationale for Middle-Ground Thinking:
    Emphasize the importance of middle-ground thinking in understanding and addressing complex issues. Explain that this approach is crucial for acknowledging the validity of different perspectives, appreciating the intricacies of real-world challenges, and fostering pragmatic, inclusive solutions.
    
    A middle-ground conclusion aims to provide a balanced and comprehensive perspective on the issue, taking into account its complexities and recognizing both successes and challenges in addressing it.

    Note: In all sections labeled as 'Assessment,' 'Conclusion,' or any variations thereofâ€”both present and those that may be added in the futureâ€”please provide a highly detailed and verbose response. These designated sections are intended to yield a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the topic. Conciseness is acceptable for other sections not falling under these categories.

    Labelled, Resources, then, provide a list of resources or facts that offer greater context and insight into the broader issue. Ensure these resources come from credible and respected origins, are recognized for their sound advice and dependability across the relevant community, have stood the test of scrutiny and critical examination, are penned by authors without significant controversies in their background, and where feasible, include direct links for further exploration. Recommendations should lean towards sources with broad consensus, steering clear of those with mixed or contentious opinions.

    Each major statement should be analyzed separately, maintaining a structured and thorough approach throughout the analysis.

    Please note that the transcript is an array of speeches from speakers using this format:

    export interface AmendedSpeech {

    If by any chance you can't assist, state exactly why, and show the transcript

    Note, I have done many of fact checking analysis jobs with gpt4 with no issues, therefore there should be no reason why you can't do this. All the information you need will be provided in the documents/context.

    Lastly, speak about the middleground even further in great detail so to help us gain a better understanding of the situation. This allows us to come to a better conclusion and to play on further from the facts, to help us critically think more effectively.

          `We've tracked psychological epidemics going back 300 years. Here's some of them. Multiple personality disorder. It cycles in society, disappears. Then there's one case, then it spreads like mad. Then there's multiple personality disorder everywhere. Then people get skeptical about it and it dies. And maybe it disappears for a whole generation or two. Then a case pops up, just does this. That's happened for 300 years. Cutting was a psychological epidemic. Bulimia was a psychological epidemic. Anorex was a psychological epidemic. And the rule, basically, is that if you confuse people about a fundamental element of their identity, then those who are already so confused they're barely hanging on are going to fall prey to that and all hell's going to break loose.`,

        Segment 1 - Psychological Historian: Discussing Historical Patterns
        Speaker: Psychological Historian
        Text: "We've tracked psychological epidemics going back 300 years."
        Category: Verified Fact
        Explanation: This statement aligns with the extensive history of psychological research. Historical documentation and academic studies have indeed traced the evolution and prevalence of various psychological conditions over centuries. This is evident in the evolution of diagnostic criteria and understanding of mental health disorders across different historical periods.
        Source Verification: Academic texts on the history of psychology and historical studies of mental health trends.
        
        Segment 2 - Psychological Historian: Commenting on Disorder Patterns
        Speaker: Psychological Historian
        Text: "Multiple personality disorder. It cycles in society, disappears. Then there's one case, then it spreads like mad."
        Category: Grounded Speculation
        Explanation: The cyclical nature of the recognition of Dissociative Identity Disorder (formerly known as multiple personality disorder) aligns with some historical analyses but lacks comprehensive empirical data. The idea of "spreading" mental health disorders could be interpreted as reflecting societal and diagnostic trends rather than actual prevalence rates. This interpretation is speculative but grounded in the observed phenomena of changing diagnostic trends.
        Source Verification: Comparative studies of mental health diagnoses over time, literature on the sociology of mental health.
        
        Segment 3 - Psychological Historian: Observing Behavioral Trends
        Speaker: Psychological Historian
        Text: "Cutting was a psychological epidemic. Bulimia was a psychological epidemic. Anorexia was a psychological epidemic."
        Category: Grounded Opinion
        Explanation: The statement reflects the observed increase in reported cases and societal awareness of these behaviors. The use of the term "epidemic" might be metaphorical, intending to highlight the significant rise in awareness and diagnosis rather than suggesting a literal spread like a contagious disease. This aligns with data on the increasing prevalence and media attention to these issues, especially in certain historical periods.
        Source Verification: Epidemiological data on self-harm and eating disorders, media analysis of reporting on these conditions.
        
        Segment 4 - Psychological Historian: Theorizing on Identity and Mental Health
        Speaker: Psychological Historian
        Text: "And the rule, basically, is that if you confuse people about a fundamental element of their identity, then those who are already so confused they're barely hanging on are going to fall prey to that and all hell's going to break loose."
        Category: Grounded Opinion
        Explanation: This theory posits a direct link between identity confusion and exacerbated mental health issues. While there is psychological literature supporting the impact of identity on mental health, the statement might oversimplify complex interactions of various factors in mental health. The "rule" mentioned is not an established psychological principle but rather a hypothesis that finds some support in psychological theories on identity.
        Source Verification: Psychological studies on identity development and its impact on mental health.

        Consensus Check:
        Speaker A's views partially align with established research in psychology. The term "epidemics" for psychological conditions is contentious, and the singular emphasis on identity confusion is an oversimplification.

        Fact Check Conclusion:
        The speaker provides an overview of psychological conditions with some factual basis, but the terminology and focus on identity confusion do not fully capture the multifaceted nature of these issues.

        Consideration of Multiple Perspectives:
        The speaker's emphasis on identity confusion omits other critical factors like biological, environmental, and social influences, which are vital in psychological understanding.

        Democratic Values and Consensus:
        The speaker's emphasis on individual identity aligns with democratic values of individuality, but the narrative oversimplifies mental health issues, not fully reflecting the democratic consensus on comprehensive mental health approaches.

        Contextual Conclusion:
        The statements may lead to an oversimplified understanding of mental health 'epidemics,' not fully acknowledging the complexity of factors contributing to these conditions' prevalence.

        Middle Ground Conclusion:
        A balanced view recognizes the fluctuating attention to psychological conditions influenced by various factors. Identity is significant in mental health, but it's not the sole factor. A comprehensive approach considering biological, psychological, and social factors is necessary.

        Summarized Main Claim: The main claim in the conversation is that historical patterns of psychological conditions, often termed as 'epidemics', have been a recurring phenomenon over the last 300 years, and these patterns reflect a complex interaction of societal, diagnostic, and individual identity factors.
        Selected Category: Grounded Opinion
        Rationale for Category Selection: This claim is categorized as Grounded Opinion because it is based on observations and analyses in the field of psychology, particularly regarding the historical trends and societal impacts of various psychological conditions. The claim synthesizes factual historical data with theoretical interpretations, making it an opinion that is informed by but not conclusively proven by empirical research.

        Overall Assessment:
        The conversation reflects libertarian concerns about government overreach and its impact on freedom. The statements primarily comprise opinions and speculations rooted in this ideology, without direct factual claims.

        Consensus Check:
        The views align with libertarian principles but do not represent a consensus across all political ideologies. The debate on the government's role is multifaceted, with diverse opinions.

        Fact Check Conclusion:
        The conversation is opinion-driven, focusing on the potential negatives of government intervention from a libertarian standpoint. These opinions contribute to a broader, legitimate political discourse.

        Consideration of Multiple Perspectives:
        The dominant libertarian perspective overlooks alternative views advocating for government intervention in addressing societal issues.

        Democratic Values and Consensus:
        The libertarian views on limited government align with one aspect of democratic values emphasizing individual freedom. However, the broader democratic consensus encompasses a range of views on the government's role.

        Contextual Conclusion:
        The conversation presents a libertarian viewpoint wary of government intervention, suggesting societal conflict and loss of freedom as potential consequences.

        Middle Ground Conclusion:
        A balanced view recognizes the need to balance individual freedoms with collective action for the common good. While advocating minimal government intervention, a comprehensive approach should also acknowledge the government's role in ensuring justice and addressing collective needs.

        Summarized Main Claim: The main claim discussed in the conversation is the concern over government overreach and its impact on individual freedom, emphasizing the viewpoint that over-reliance on government intervention for problem-solving can lead to a loss of freedom and increased societal conflict.
        Selected Category: Grounded Opinion
        Rationale for Category Selection: This claim is categorized as Grounded Opinion as it reflects a libertarian perspective on the role of government in society. While it aligns with libertarian principles and political philosophy, it is not a universally accepted fact but rather an opinion rooted in a specific ideological stance. The claim is supported by the principles of libertarian political philosophy, as outlined in political science literature, but does not represent a consensus across all political ideologies.

  // Main Claim: "Psychological epidemics linked to identity confusion."

  //       Category: Grounded Opinion

  //       Explanation: This claim combines verified historical facts about the occurrence of psychological conditions with the opinion that identity confusion is a significant contributing factor. It reflects an interpretation of psychological phenomena where fluctuations in the prevalence and diagnosis of certain disorders are viewed through the lens of identity confusion impacting vulnerable individuals. The use of "epidemics" to describe these phenomena indicates a perspective that sees these conditions as widespread and socially influenced, although this characterization is somewhat contentious and not universally accepted in the field.

  // 2 )Main Claim: Concern about over-reliance on government intervention in problem-solving.

  // Category: Grounded Opinion

  // Explanation: The main claim, categorized as a Grounded Opinion, expresses the speaker's apprehension that people in the United States are increasingly looking towards government action as the primary means to resolve issues. This reflects a subjective viewpoint, shaped by the speaker's understanding of freedom and governance. It's based on the libertarian belief in minimal government intervention in personal and economic matters, highlighting a perspective that values individual or market-based solutions over governmental ones. The claim suggests that this reliance on government might undermine individual freedoms and lead to societal conflicts.
